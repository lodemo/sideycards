# SideyCards

SideyCards is a very simple jekyll theme based on [Sidey](https://github.com/ronv/sidey). Template for my personal webpage.

Main difference to Sidey is the introduction of Cards for the post previews. Addtionally SEO optimizations are removed and Robots.txt is configured *against* search engine scraping.
